## Gloom Multi Tool V2

### What is coming soon?
- I will be coding the rest of the modules and I will add another mode (gui mode)
- for the old-style mode (like v1 - v1.3.0) I will be replacing the shell-style's behaviour with old-style like behaviour

## Important Notice!
There has been a series of scams going on youtube claiming to be Gloom, https://github.com/Renovsk/Gloom-Multi-Tool IS THE ONLY OFFICIAL DOWNLOAD FOR GLOOM
Spread the word!
